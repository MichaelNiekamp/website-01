        <pre>When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king

            What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight

            And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring

            There's nobody to batter when your mind is your might

            So when you go solo you hold your own hand

            And remember that depth is the greatest of heights

            And if you know where you stand then you know where to land

            And if you fall it won't matter 'cause you'll know that you're right</pre>
