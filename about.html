        <p>Fiona Apple was born in New York City with her father being an actor and her mother being a muician.
            By the age of 8, Apple was trained on the piano and began composing her own pieces.
            As a child, she dealt with many struggles and survived a very serious assault that evolved into ptsd, depression, and an eating disorder.
            She is a big advocate of justice in the criminal court system as well as animal welfare.
            Apple's poem "When the Pawn Hits the Conflict" is a response to her experience in the music industry.
